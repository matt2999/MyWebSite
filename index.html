        <h2>Gaming</h2>
        <p>One of my favorite things is playing video games with the boys. At this moment I mainly play on PS5 and some of my favorite     games are Call of Duty and NBA 2K. I have been playing video games since I was I think around 6 when I got my Wii for christmas. I've been through many game consoles through the years including a Wii, Nintendo DS, Xbox 360, Xbox one, ps4, and currently PS5 and a gaming PC. I think it is a great way to have fun and spend time with friends.</p>
        <h2>Walking/Biking</h2>
        <p>Another thing that I like to do is ride bike and go for walks on the rail trails. I started riding when I was younger when my dad wanted to go and I haven't stopped since. I love getting out on the trails because it is great excersize and a way to see nature. I enjoy biking more but walking is good too. My longest ride was from Sabraton to Pricketts fort which I think was around a 60 mile bike ride.</p>
