        <p>The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie</p>
        <p>My favorite movie is a childhood classic. I remember watching it as a kid and i've never had the same enjoyment from a movie. I used to be a big fan of Spongebob when I was A kid so this was easily the best movie I was younger. I don't really watch that many movies but I really remember this one. I still watch it if I get the chance to this day.</p>
