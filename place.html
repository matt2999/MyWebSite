        <p>Outer Banks, North Carolina</p>
        <p>One of my favorite places is the Outer Banks. I have been there 5 times over my life and evertime I go there I have a great time. There are great beaches and Islands to explore and the people there are really cool. Tons of attractions to do like shipreck diving and beatiful tours. Overall a great place to visit on vacation. </p>
